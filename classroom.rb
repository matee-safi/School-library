# Create the has-many/belongs-to relationship between Classroom and Student. The following should be implemented:
# Create the has-many side (a classroom has many students).
# Create the belongs-to side (a student belongs to a classroom).
# Make sure that when adding a student to a classroom it also sets the classroom for the student.
# Make sure that when setting the classroom for a student it also adds it to the classrooms' students.
